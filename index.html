    <h4>1. check whether a given number is prime or not using while loop
        1. Sum of Even Numbers
        
        Write a program to find the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 50 using a while loop.
        
        Example: The output should be 650.
        
        2. Count Digits
        
        Write a program that takes a number as input and counts the number of digits in it using a while loop.
        
        Example: Input: 12345 → Output: 5
        3. Find Minimum Digit
        
        Write a program to find the smallest digit in a given number using a while loop.
        
        Example: Input: 27649 → Output: 2
        
        4. Sum of Odd Digits
        
        Write a program that takes a number as input and calculates the sum of all its odd digits using a while loop.
        
        Example: Input: 13579 → Output: 25
        5. Perfect Number Check
        
        A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself). Write a program to check if a given number is a perfect number.
        
        Example: Input: 28 → Output: true (since 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28)
